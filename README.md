# Web Audio Inspector

Web Audio Inspector is a Chrome extension that adds a "Web Audio" panel to Developer Tools. This panel visualizes the `AudioNode` graph generated by Web Audio API JavaScript. Install the extension from its [Chrome Web Store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-audio-inspector/cmhomipkklckpomafalojobppmmidlgl).

# Development

## Build Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 6 or above.
- [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) version 7 or above if necessary.

## Contribution

1. Review CONTRIBUTING.md. Note that Google requires contributors to sign a [Contributors License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).
2. Set up [2-factor authentication for Github](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication) (as Google requires).
3. Clone the repository with the `git@` address. The `https` address does not work with 2-factor authentication.

## Build and run

Run the following commands in the project root directory.

```bash
npm install   # Install Node modules
gulp          # Build the extension
```

Then load the `build` directory as an [unpacked Chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

## Code Layout

This project uses the [Google Closure JavaScript library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) and [Google's JavaScript style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

The extension comprises of several scripts. Each script corresponds to a Closure entry point (JS file) within `js/entry-points`.

* **tracing.js**: The tracing code is run before any scripts of a web page run. It adds tracking code to functions of the Web Audio API.
* **inject-tracing.js**: This script injects the tracing code (above) into a web page. It is a [content script](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts).
* **background.js**: The background script routes messages to and from various scripts. For instance, web audio updates from content scripts are routed to the corresponding dev tools scripts.
* **dev-tools.js**: The [dev tools script](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools#devtools-page) is run when the user opens Chrome Developer Tools. The script adds a `Web Audio` panel to Developer Tools. It routes messages to logic within the panel.
* **panel.js**: This script manages the UI for the panel within Developer Tools. It uses [JointJS](https://github.com/clientIO/joint) for rendering graphs and [dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) for layout.
* **tab-page-changed.js**: This simple script detects when the URL within a tab changes.

## Testing

Tests reside in the `tests` directory and use Closure's jsunit library. Tests run in a web browser. Each test has a `_test.html` file (which sets up DOM elements required by the test) and a `_test.js` file (which contains the bulk testing logic). To run all tests at once,

1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies if you have not done so.
2. Run `gulp test` to start a static server. This command also uses your default browser (preferably [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)) to open a web page (pictured below) for running all tests at once.

To run tests individually, you can use that UI as well, or you could visit the path to that test's `_test.html` file.
